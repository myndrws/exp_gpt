Make up a very long patient history in the style of a UK NHS doctor.
This is for a patient that is female and 87 years old and is now complaining of lower back pain and dizziness.
This patient history needs to include full medical history including allergies and incidents and previous visits.
It should also include any changes to conditions over the patient's lifetime.
Make the patient history convoluted and detailed and sometimes difficult to understand.
