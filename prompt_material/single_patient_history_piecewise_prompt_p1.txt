Make up a long and messy page of notes from a patient appointment in the style of an NHS nurse.

Use patient details:
name: Mr. F.
sex: male
age: 28
symptoms: cough, vertigo, weight loss.

Include things like: 
Full medical history.
Treatments.
Allergies.
Incidents.
Lifestyle.
Previous visits.
Changes to conditions.
Other details like home life.

The notes should be unstructured.
