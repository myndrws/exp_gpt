Make up a very long patient history in the style of a UK NHS doctor.

Use patient details:
sex: female, age: 87, current symptoms: back pain, dizziness

Include full medical history including allergies, incidents, previous visits, changes to conditions.

Make the patient history convoluted and detailed. It should be a very long patient history.
