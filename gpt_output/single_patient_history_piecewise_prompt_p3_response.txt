Referral Note:
Mr. F., a 45 year-old male, presented to our office with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. During his previous visit, he denied any alcohol or tobacco use and reported no additional changes in his lifestyle. Vital signs were monitored and a chest exam was performed. Antibiotics were prescribed for a cough.

Given the patient's reported symptoms and the results of his previous visit, we are recommending a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis. Specifically, we suggest an echocardiogram to assess for any possible cardiac abnormalities. We also suggest a pulmonary function test to evaluate the patient's lung function and possible obstructive issues. In addition, we recommend a complete blood count to assess for any possible anemia or other underlying medical issues. 

Finally, we suggest a physician referral for any additional medical management, as needed. 

We appreciate your attention to this patient and look forward to seeing the results of these tests. Thank you.
