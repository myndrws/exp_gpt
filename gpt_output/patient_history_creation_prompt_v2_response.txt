Mrs X is an 87 year old female patient. She first came to the NHS for treatment when she was 8 years old for a minor illness, however she had no significant medical history until she was in her late twenties when she was diagnosed with a mild form of arthritis in her lower back and hips. This was managed with medication and regular physiotherapy over the next few years. She also had a history of asthma when she was a child, which she has managed well with medication and regular check-ups.

At the age of 56, Mrs X had a fall which resulted in a broken hip. She was treated with a hip replacement and went on to have a full recovery. Since then, she has had no complications or further falls.

Mrs X has had several minor illnesses over the years and made regular visits to the GP, but there have been no major health concerns. Prior to her current complaint, she had no allergies or any other reported conditions. 

In the past year, Mrs X has started to experience lower back pain, which has been gradually worsening over this time period. She also reported feeling dizzy at times. After a few visits to the GP, the cause of her symptoms was determined to be an underlying degenerative condition in her lower back. Mrs X was prescribed medication to manage her pain and advised to do regular stretches and exercises to maintain her mobility. 

Unfortunately, Mrs X's pain has not improved and her symptoms have become worse in the past few months, leading her to visit the GP again. She was referred to a specialist for a full assessment, and is currently awaiting the results.
