Referral Note:
Mr. F., a 45 year-old male, presented to our office with complaints of chest pain and shortness of breath. During his previous visit, he denied any alcohol or tobacco use and reported no additional changes in his lifestyle. Vital signs were monitored and a chest exam was performed. Antibiotics were prescribed for a cough.

Given the patient's reported symptoms and the results of his previous visit, we are recommending a follow-up test to confirm the diagnosis. Specifically, we suggest an echocardiogram to assess for any possible cardiac abnormalities. We also suggest a pulmonary function test to evaluate the patient's lung function and possible obstructive issues. In addition, we recommend a complete blood count to assess for any possible anemia or other underlying medical issues. We also recommend a lipid panel.

Finally, we suggest a physician referral for any additional medical management, as needed. 

We appreciate your attention to this patient and look forward to seeing the results of these tests. Thank you.

ECHOCARDIOGRAM DIAGNOSIS
Mr. F, a 45-year-old male, has presented with chest pain and shortness of breath. An echocardiogram was performed and revealed moderate left ventricular systolic dysfunction, with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%. Other findings included mild aortic regurgitation and normal left ventricular size.

PULMONARY FUNCTION TEST DIAGNOSIS
A pulmonary function test was also performed which revealed mild restriction of airflow.

TREATMENT
Mr. F has been prescribed angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors to improve left ventricular function and reduce aortic regurgitation, as well as bronchodilators to improve pulmonary function. Additionally, he has been advised to adopt a healthy lifestyle and make dietary changes to reduce his risk of heart disease. Follow-up echocardiograms and pulmonary function tests will be performed to monitor his progress.
